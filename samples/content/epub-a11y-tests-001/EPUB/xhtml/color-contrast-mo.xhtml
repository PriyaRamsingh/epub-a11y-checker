          This page contains bad examples of contrast for both the actively-playing text as well as for the shaded-out inactive items.
        </p>
        <p id="t5">
          As the Media Overlays playback continues, you can see that the highlighted text stands out, but does not have enough contrast between its own foreground and background colors.
        </p>
        <p id="t6">
          The text that's not currently being played also changes style when you press play, but its contrast is too low to pass WCAG level AA.
